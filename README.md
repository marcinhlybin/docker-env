# Docker environments manager

**docker-env** allows developers to create, manage and switch between isolated docker projects (or stacks) per git branch within a single repository. It simplifies working with docker-compose and supports hooks for customization and sidecar containers for optional services.

## Why

Managing Docker environments across multiple branches or projects can be cumbersome, especially when dealing with complex application stacks that include databases, caches, and other services.

The goal of docker-env is to streamline this process by automating the creation and management of docker-compose environments. Each environment is tied to a Git branch, allowing developers to easily switch between isolated stacks without affecting their work in progress. This ensures that data, services, and application states are preserved across branches and projects.

In short, docker-env abstracts common docker-compose tasks, allowing you to focus on development while it handles the heavy lifting.

## Key features

- Project (or stack) per branch. Create a new environment automatically when switching branches.
- Repository isolation: Prefix project by repository name, ensuring no conflicts between different repositories.
- Sidecar containers: Optional services, like admin tools or background jobs, can be started as needed without starting by default.
- Hooks: Customize pre-start, post-start, and post-stop behaviors with hooks.

## Installing

On MacOS use Homebrew to install:

```
brew install marcinhlybin/tap/docker-env
```

On Linux see building or download binary from releases.

## Building

Run `make` to build a binary to the current directory.

```
brew install go
make test
make install
```

Installs into `/usr/local/bin`. Sudo password required.

```

## Docker compose

### Requirements

Container name in service definition **must be prefixed** with `$COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-`:

```
services:
  app:
    container_name: $COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-app
    image: 1234567890.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/my-app
    ports:
    [...]
```

### Extending docker compose configuration

By default **docker-env** uses `docker-compose.yml` for service definition. The configuration can be extended with `docker-compose.override.yml`.

### Variables

Docker compose configuration can be manipulated with environmental variables stored in `env_files` defined in `./docker-env/config.yml` file. Usually it is local `.env` file which should be added to `.gitignore` as it may contain secrets like `GITHUB_TOKEN` or AWS credentials.

By setting `required_vars` option in `./docker-env/config.yml` you can check during runtime if variables can be found.

### Sidecar containers

By default **docker-env** uses `app` profile to start contianers. Profile `sidecar` is used to specify containers that are not started by default and can be started later individually using `docker-env start -s` command.

Profile names are defined in the configuration file:

```
compose_default_profile: app
compose_sidecar_profile: sidecar
```

## Configuration

Each repository should define its own configuration file located in `./docker-env/config.yml`. It is recommended to commit config file to the repository. It can be extended locally with `./docker-env/config.override.yml` (add it to `.gitignore`). For example it can be used to replace registry images and build own using `docker-env build` command.

```
### Docker-env configuration file

# Docker compose projects and their containers will be prefixed with this name
# Only alphanumeric characters and underscores are allowed, no hyphens
# Make sure to name service names in the docker-compose.yml file
# using "$COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-" prefix
compose_project_name: docker_env

# Docker compose configuration
compose_file: docker-compose.yml
compose_file_override: docker-compose.override.yml

# Profiles are used to distinguish between default startup services
# and services that are only started when explicitly requested by the user
# so called sidecar services
compose_default_profile: app
compose_sidecar_profile: sidecar

# Git options
git_default_branch: master

# Debug options
show_executed_commands: true

# Env files to load environmental variables used in the docker-compose.yml file
# for substitution in the services section
env_files:
  - .env

# Check for following environment variables in env files
required_vars:
  - GITHUB_USER
  - GITHUB_TOKEN
  - AWS_PROFILE
  - AWS_MFA_SERIAL

# AWS registry
aws_login: false
aws_region: eu-central-1
aws_repository: 1234567890.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com

# Use MFA (multi-factor authentication) for AWS login
# Requires AWS_MFA_SERIAL environment variable to be set in the .env file
# Sample value: arn:aws:iam::1234567890:mfa/User123
aws_mfa: false
aws_mfa_duration_seconds: 3600 # 1 hour

# Command defaults
terminal_default_service: app
terminal_default_command: /bin/bash
vscode_default_service: app
vscode_default_dir: /app

# If you are using a different flavor of VSCode, for example Cursor
# set the appropriate binary for the code command
vscode_binary: code

# Scripts to run before and after
pre_start_hooks:
  - .docker-env/pre-start.d/10-add-ssl-certificate-linux.sh
  - .docker-env/pre-start.d/10-add-ssl-certificate-macos.sh
  - .docker-env/pre-start.d/20-ports.sh
  - .docker-env/pre-start.d/30-ssh-agent.sh

post_start_hooks:
  - .docker-env/post-start.d/10-show-message.sh

post_stop_hooks:
  - .docker-env/post-stop.d/10-node-modules.sh

```

## Hooks

Supported hooks are:

- pre-start
- post-start
- post-stop

Arguments passed to the hooks are `PROJECT_NAME` and `SERVICE_NAME` as positional arguments.

```
# In bash script use:
PROJECT_NAME="$1"
SERVICE_NAME="$2"
```

Sample hooks can be found in `.docker-env/` directory to:

- Generate SSL certificates
- Run ssh-agent
- Check ports availability

## Troubleshooting

### Error running docker command: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

Set `DOCKER_HOST` to docker socket in your home directory:

```
export DOCKER_HOST="unix:///$HOME/.docker/run/docker.sock"
```

or in Docker Desktop in Settings -> Advanced select `Allow the default Docker socket to be used (requires password)`

### Error getting AWS registry password: Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".

Export `AWS_PROFILE` variables matching the profile in `~/.aws/credentials`:

```
export AWS_PROFILE=default
```

## Release

1. Change version in `version/version.go`
2. Create a tag
3. Run goreleaser

```
vim version/version.go
git commit -m 'First release'
git push origin master
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First release"
goreleaser release --clean
```
